<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

Growing up, my sister and I would UNO one-on-one for hours until one of us was too ticked-off to continue. The game is usually most fun with at least 3 players because cards like reverse and skip don't work exactly the same with 2 players. Everyone has their own 'house rules' for the game but I tried to stick as close to the rulebook as I could.

With my UNO remake, all you need is a device with a big, wide screen (like an iPad or laptop). The cards and people to play the game come ready when you launch my URL. You will be matched against three random opponents (friends of mine who are on-call 24/7). The first one to get rid of all their cards wins!
