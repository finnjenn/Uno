<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

Growing up, my sister and I would play UNO one-on-one for hours until one of us was too ticked-off to continue. The game is usually most fun with at least 3 players because cards like reverse and skip don't work exactly the same with 2 players. Everyone has their own 'house rules' for the game but I tried to stick as close to the rulebook as I could. UNO rules are simple.

- You can get rid of a card on your turn if it matches either the color or the number of the card on top of the discard pile.
  (Top of discard pile is a Red 1. You can play any red card or any card with the number 1)
- Black cards are wild cards. They can be played regardless of what is on top of the discard pile. Once played, you will get to choose the new color of the discard pile.
- If you do not have any cards that match the top of the discard pile, you can draw one card from the deck. If the card you drew is playable you can put it down but if it is not, your turn is over.
- +2 and +4 cards cannot be stacked. When one is played, the next player is given their extra cards and continues their turn.
- First player to have 0 cards wins!

With my UNO remake, all you need is a device with a big, wide screen (like an iPad or laptop). The cards and people to play the game come ready when you launch my URL. You will be matched against three random opponents (friends of mine who are on-call 24/7). Good luck!

<h2 id="whatILearned">What I Learned</h2>

- JavaScript One-Liners: Before starting this project, I was reading an article from freeCodeCamp about small pieces of code that are so common you might use them in every project. These <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-one-liners-to-use-in-every-project/">one-liners</a> were so useful I ended up using a few.

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

Simply clone the project and open using the index.html file or open the live site with <a href="https://finnjenn.github.io/knowYourTypeV2/">Github Pages</a>

You (the user) get to go first at the start of every new game. Either click a card in your hand to play it or click the deck in the middle to draw a card. Your hand is highlighted and slightly rasises itself when it is back to your turn.
